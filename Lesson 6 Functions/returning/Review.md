Congrats! 

This lesson covered how to:

- Define a function.
- Understand scope rules.
- Return a value from a function.
- Add parameters to our function.
- Reuse code with functions.
- Return multiple values from a function.
-  Defer events until the conclusion of a function.
-  Functions are one of the most valuable patterns in code writing and reusability. Being comfortable writing and calling them will serve you well as you go on to build more complex software.
