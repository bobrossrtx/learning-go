# Hey,

## I'm owen, I'm learning GoLang because:
> - I believe it is a better starting point then jumping straight in with the harder languages.
> - I think of it as w way to expand my knowledge for some harder to learn languages like `JavaScript` or `C#`.
> - It is an amazing and flexible language for problem solving, machine learning, network programming and buch more.
> - Go has a simple and beginner friendly syntax with good looking, straight forward code.

Since I have intermit knowledge of basic HTML and CSS I decided to learn Go to develop backend server side code and data for future sites I end up building.

Yes, I know that learning a more upfront and modernly used language like `JavaScript` would benefit me more since there are alot more libraries and frameworks especially when it comes to node but I thought of ths as a better starting point instead of Hitting the harder stuff up first like i have been for the past 2 months
